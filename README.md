> This demo project shows how to use plain Javascript and HTML to broadcast the mobile device orientation using the HTMLs device orientation API.

## Install

Start the backend with `dotnet run` after installing the dotnet cli [get it here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)

For the frontend do:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

start the backend at the console with `dotnet run` and start the frontend with an `npm start`. Now you can move your laptop or device to see the picture moving. If you upload it to a webserver you can see taht ASP.NET Core SignalR is broadcasting the movements to other devices.
